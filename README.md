# MyPortfolioPage
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio webpage, designed as part of ICT Lab Task #12. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create an interactive and responsive web page. The project showcases my skills, experience, and personal details in a visually appealing format.
